## 📌 Overview

Modern lending requires more than rule-based decisioning. Borrowers expect fast, fair, and personalized financial products. Lenders need precision risk assessment and agile pricing mechanisms. **Loan-Genius-AI** addresses this by:

* Predicting loan eligibility in real-time using supervised learning.
* Personalizing interest rates based on credit risk via regression models.
* Providing an interactive web interface for both applicants and credit analysts.

> The result: increased approval efficiency, reduced default rates, and optimized yield on credit portfolios.

## 🔑 Core Capabilities

### 🧠 AI-Driven Loan Decisioning

Classifies applicants into "Approved" or "Declined" based on input attributes using trained machine learning classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).

### 💰 Dynamic Interest Rate Prediction

Utilizes regression models to assign personalized interest rates based on predicted creditworthiness, enabling adaptive risk-based pricing.

### 🖥️ Interactive Frontend

A responsive, browser-based interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to submit loan requests and view instant predictions.

### 📈 Explainability & Insights

Integrates feature importance and interpretable outputs to support explainable AI (XAI) in regulatory-sensitive environments.
